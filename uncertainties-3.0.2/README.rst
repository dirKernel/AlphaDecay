GitHub
------

The ``master`` branch is for Python 2.7+ (including Python 3+ through
``2to3``), while the ``master_python2.3`` branch is for Python 2.3 to
2.6 (with unit tests only run with Python 2.6).

Other ``master*`` branches in the Github repository are bleeding-edge, 
but they are *working* versions that passed the tests for many versions 
of Python starting at 2.4.

Other branches might be present in the GitHub repository, but they are
temporary and represent work in progress that does not necessarily run
properly yet.
